# Lesson 5 â€“ Weather App: API Fetching
For our last lesson, we will be building a Flutter application to fetch and parse weather data from MetaWeather.

## Part 1 - Visit the MetaWeather Docs
The API documentation for MetaWeather is located [here](https://www.metaweather.com/api/).  By making two calls to this API, we can acquire current weather data for the a given location.  The process for this is as follows:

### Perform a Location Search
In order to request the current weather information for a particular location, we first must obtain the corresponding WOEID ("Where On Earth ID").

The respective URL endpoint for this query is: `https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?lattlong=(latt),(long)`. You'll need to reference this later on.

*Example Usage:* https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?lattlong=34.0224,-118.2851

MetaWeather's response fields (for a string query) include:

| Field        | Type  |
|:------------:|:-----:|
| title        | string|
| location_type| string|
| latt_long    | floats|
| woeid        | int   |

From our query results, we'll be saving the WOEID for later use.

### Perform a Weather Query Using WOEID
As some further background on the MetaWeather API, after obtaining the WOEID then we must perform a query on the current weather at that location.

The respective URL endpoint for this query is `https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/(woeid)/`. You'll need to reference this later on, too.

*Example Usage:* https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2487956/

## Part 2 - Setting Up the Data Models
We'll be three classes to represent the data that we retrieve from the MetaWeather API.  We'll begin by initializing our project and setting up these classes.

### Project Setup
Begin by launching Android Studio and creating a new Flutter Application.  In order to use the same imports listed in our code snippets, be sure to name your Flutter Application `weather_app`.

### LocationData Class
As we mentioned in the API introduction, our first call to the MetaWeather endpoints will be passing in a latitude and a longitude to obtain the desired location's WOEID ("Where On Earth ID").
